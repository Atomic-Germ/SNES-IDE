# Project Directory Structure

You **must** organize your folders as follows:

```sh
SNES-IDE/
├── linux/
    ├── installers/
        ├── README.md
        ├── python/ 
        └──────  # here you will put the python installer for your configured wine.
        
```

## NOTICE

I'm not going to upload the installers, so if you want to build from source in linux system, download the installers for python and visual studio build tools by your own. The folders must be written with those names, the automatizer will try to find them with these names, and it is case sensitive, so be careful. The installer name doesnt matters, but you should only put one file for this folder, and this should be the installer.
