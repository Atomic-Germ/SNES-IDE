## Testing

### Build Tests

[![Build (Green Light)](https://github.com/BrunoRNS/SNES-IDE/actions/workflows/Windows.yml/badge.svg?branch=windows%2Fci)](https://github.com/Atomic-Germ/SNES-IDE/actions/workflows/Windows.yml)

- These should never be failing. If they do, fix the build until red
status is green and then move them.

### Green-Light Tests

[![Tests (Green Light)](https://github.com/BrunoRNS/SNES-IDE/actions/workflows/Windows.yml/badge.svg?branch=windows%2Fgreen)](https://github.com/BrunoRNS/SNES-IDE/actions/workflows/Windows.yml)

- Run automatically in CI after each build.
- Check for presence of key libraries and executables.
- Example:  
  - `libs/bsnes`, `libs/font`, `tools/snes-ide.exe`, etc.

### Red-Light Tests

[![Tests (Red Light)](https://github.com/BrunoRNS/SNES-IDE/actions/workflows/Windows.yml/badge.svg?branch=windows%2Fred)](https://github.com/BrunoRNS/SNES-IDE/actions/workflows/Windows.yml)

- Only run on the `windows/red` branch.
- Used for TDD: write failing tests before implementing new features.

## Contributing

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch (`<os>/feature-xyz`)
- Write tests first (Red-Light), then implement features until tests pass (Green-Light). These should be in the appropriate workflow section.
- Submit pull requests to `devel`
- See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for community guidelines
