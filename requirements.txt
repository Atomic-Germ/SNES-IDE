# SNES-IDE Python runtime / build dependencies
# These are minimal, best-effort entries required for building and CI tasks.
# - Install with: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

pyinstaller
wheel

# Optional / developer dependencies (uncomment to install):
pytest
pyyaml

# Notes:
# - tkinter is part of the Python standard library on most platforms but
#   requires system Tcl/Tk (not installed via pip). Keep that in mind for GUI
#   features and CI runners.
# - We intentionally left versions unpinned here; follow-up task will pin and
#   audit versions for reproducible builds and security.
